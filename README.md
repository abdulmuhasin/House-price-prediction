# House-price-prediction
This project predicts house prices using machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, and model evaluation with metrics like MAE, MSE, and R²<br>
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices using a dataset of housing features. The main goal is to explore different regression techniques and evaluate their performance in predicting the prices accurately.<br>
